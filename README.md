# Data_Science_Project


In this project we will build a basic machine learning model to predict the risk analysis and how the data is used to minimize the risk of losing money while lending to customers. By analyzing historical loan application data, we will identify patterns and factors that indicate whether a client is likely to default on their loan payments. This analysis will assist the company in minimizing financial losses while ensuring that creditworthy applicants are not unfairly rejected.

In conclusion, this project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to predict loan defaults effectively. By leveraging historical data and building robust predictive models, financial institutions can make more informed decisions and minimize potential losses due to defaults.
